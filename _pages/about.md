My name is Ioannis Pavlos Zoulakis and I am a master-thesis student in [High Power Electronics Laboratory](https://hpe.ee.ethz.ch) of [Jürgen Biela](https://hpe.ee.ethz.ch) in ETH Zürich. My research interests lie principally in magnetics but broadly to design and control of power electronics (DC/DC, DC/AC and AC/DC) and electric motors (of all types) for power conversion applications.


Background
======
Before moving to Sweden and start my master-level studies in ''All-Electric Propulsion Systems'' programme of Uppsala University, which I served as Teaching Assistant. I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Democritus University of Thrace. I was specialized in electronics and my diploma thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Georgios Ch. Sirakoulis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=WhBartYAAAAJ&hl=el). During my bachelor studies I also enjoyed a professional research experience in National Center for Scientific Research [Demokritos](https://www.demokritos.gr/), as also a volunteer respective one in [Democritus Racing Team](https://drt-racing.duth.gr/en/).
