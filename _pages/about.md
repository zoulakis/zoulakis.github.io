My name is Ioannis Pavlos Zoulakis and I come from two beautiful islands of Greece, Kefalonia and Crete. I was born in Athens in 2000 to two mathematicians and, nowadays, I am a MSc. student in "All-Electric Propulsion Systems" at Uppsala University. 

Before moving to Sweden, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Democritus University of Thrace. I was specialized in Electronics and my diploma thesis was conducted under the supervision of [Georgios Ch. Sirakoulis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=WhBartYAAAAJ&hl=el). During my Bachelor studies, I also enjoyed a professional research experience in National Center for Scientific Research [Demokritos](https://www.demokritos.gr/), as also a volunteer respective one in [Democritus Racing Team](https://drt-racing.duth.gr/en/).



Research interests
======
Interested in research centered around Power Electronics and Electric Motors applied in electrified vehicles, from many different perspectives; Design, Control and Electromagnetics. Over the current period, I am searching for a summer job which will provide me the opportunity to apply my knowledge in a specific project. Please, feel free to reach me out if the interest is bidirectional.
